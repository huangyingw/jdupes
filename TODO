- Option -R should not have to be separated from the rest,
  such that "jdupes -dR testdir", "jdupes -d -R testdir",
  "jdupes -Rd testdir", etc., all yield the same results.

- Add option to highlight or identify symlinked files (suggest
  using --classify to identify symlinks with @ suffix... when
  specified, files containing @ are listed using \@).

- Consider option to match only to files in specific directory.

- Add a way to store stat() info + inital and full hashes for
  explicit loading in future runs to speed up repeated calls to
  the program.
